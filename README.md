## Project Status 🚧

This calendar app is inspired by the "React/Redux Developer Task - React Calendar with Reminders" project by the author [drydenwilliams](https://github.com/drydenwilliams). While the functionality is intended to be the same, reminders are not yet implemented. Currently, a weekly calendar has been added as a substitute. The project is considered completed.

## Notes 📝

- Added CSS Modules to improve style management.
- Updated to Redux Toolkit for more efficient state management.
- Changed class components to functional components to adopt modern practices.
- Introduced TypeScript for improved code integrity and scalability.
- Included the `classnames` library as suggested by the original author [drydenwilliams](https://github.com/drydenwilliams).
- Preserved part of the original comments and added some based on my own documentation (perhaps I also added more comments, but I'm not sure! 😄).
- Fixed the error that prevented rendering the month of December.
