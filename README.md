# React Calendar

This Calendar is taken from: [React/Redux Developer Task - React Calender with Reminders](https://github.com/drydenwilliams/react-calendar)

The functionality of the calendar is the same detailed in the author's repository [drydenwilliams](https://github.com/drydenwilliams).

### Installation

```
yarn

yarn start // http://localhost:3000/
```

### Comments

I need a calendar for a project, I certainly have some experience working with calendars in VBA, but it's not the same and I don't think I've worked cleanly back then. I found this project and it's really cool, I did some minimal updates.

- Change to [`CSS Modules`](https://keepcoding.io/blog/css-modules-en-react/)
- Update to [`Redux Toolkit`](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- Change Class in Functional Components
- Add [`classnames`](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames) as suggestion for [drydenwilliams](https://github.com/drydenwilliams)
- Part of the commented code has been preserved, but I don't remember adding more comments ðŸ˜„
